 elitefinalfrontier.44.desc:0 "The team lands on the desert planet, a teal blue hue washes over the horizon as the white sun burns overhead. On the distance a dust cloud gathers. One crewman of the shuttle signals the others to scout it but it appears to come closer.\n\nWithin view is a vehicle with no driver. It parks in front of the crew of the shuttle, when suddenly the hood opens and seemingly out walks the engine. It whirrs and grinds until it greets the crew in our language, offering other translations as well. It introduces itself as 'Robby'"

Pulling up to the entrance of the lavish apartment overlooking a scenic lake, Robby announced the crew's arrival. As they unbuckle their seatbelts, Dr. Edward Morbius warmly welcomes them, inviting to join him for lunch, featuring Robby's own synthetics.\n\nAfter a hearty meal, there was a demonstration of Robby's abilities. Dr. Morbius orders Robby to aim a pistol at the commander's head and fire. Initially hesitant, Robby experiences a malfunction as he struggles to process the command. Dr. Morbius continued to show off the many security features he had installed, though there were never any signs of life on the entire planet.\n\nWhen asked of what occured of the others, he only described it as 'some devlish thing that never once showed itself' and an invisible nightmare, the previous expedition had been vaporized in an attempt to leave the planet\n\nBefore the conversation can continue, a young woman walks into the room, introducing herself. Alta, Morbius reveals, is his daughter, he had a relationship with the biochemist from the previous expedition. Robby and Alta serve the crew coffee. One of the crewmates questioned whether Alta was being held captive, however, Morbius assures, she may return to Earth whenever she pleases, something she dismisses as she has her father, Robby and her friends."
