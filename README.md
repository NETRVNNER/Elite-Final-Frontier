# "FAQ" #

# THERE'S A YELLOW CAUTION SIGN IN MY LAUNCHER, WILL THIS BREAK MY GAME? #
The base E:FF mod is being tested with the latest version of Stellaris and is kept as compatible as early as possible.
Some mods may be out of date, however, with auto-updates I will be ensuring base compatibility with the latest version.
The "curated" mod pack is being tested with each update and was tested between 3.9 - 3.11 with very few errors.
Mods that do not work in the "cuated" mod back will be removed or archived as experiemental.

# WHO MADE THIS? #

One dude as a hobby, first time making a Stellaris mod. A little bit over his head. (See Why is it here)
I'm a music producer and wanted to practice coding.


# WHO IS THIS FOR? #

Fans of Elite (1984), Frontier: Elite 2, Frontier: First Encounters and Elite: Dangerous

	This is a non-canon "syncretist" view on the Elite lore, which seeks to link Elite (1984) with Elite: Dangerous.

# WHAT IS THIS? #

It's a non-canon prequel partial conversion mod for Stellaris set in the Elite: Dangerous universe. Using largley vanilla Stellaris as a basis for additional mod compatibility.
Set in the universe's ancient history, players take on the role of leaders from either the Federation or the Empire. 
Both factions struggle in the early game to ensure their survival, but can outgrow the penalties with the right choices.
The compatible mod pack adds more internal political and logistical dynamics such as faction radicalism, expanded policies, civil wars and truly daunting space.
Expand your experience with additional mods as the curated mod pack is only a basis that is tested internally.
All assets are vanilla Stellaris. Meaning additional technology, tradition, or ship mods will likely be compatible.

# WHERE CAN I FIND THIS #

Not sure why you're asking if you're reading this particular document but Steam Workshop and Paradox mods.

# WHEN CAN I PLAY #

This is designed with vanilla Stellaris as a basis, however, for the full experience make sure the mods from the curated pack are in your playlist and enabled.
Ensure the correct load order.
Singleplayer tested.
Coop untested.
Multiplayer untested.

# WHY IS THIS HERE #

I loved the way Star Wars: Legacy of the Old Republic showcased so much of Star Wars history.
To me, it was an incredible experience to see the rise of the Republic and fight the Mandalorian Wars.
When I tried playing vanilla Stellaris, I tried to make a lore friendly Elite: Dangerous start for fun.
This lead me down the rabbit hole of modding Stellaris as I already have experience coding and wanted to practice.
When I tried the Real Space mod, it just absolutely clicked for me.
Playing Starfield made me so disappointed that it kept me motivated to work on this mod. It was a great visual for barren worlds.
I always wanted to make a soundtrack for a game or mod. The song "Yearn (Reprise)" was originally meant for a custom music mod for Age of Empires II.
What you'll be playing is what I feel is what a Paradox game would feel like set in the Elite universe.
Lastly, just wanted to explain the intention of this mod so that you, reader, know that this is also yours to edit, tweak or change.
You are fully allowed to edit this and tweak it to your liking.
This mod will continue to be updated. Largely for compatibility, fixes and balancing.

# HOW DO I CHANGE SOMETHING #
	Open your favorite application like notepad, notepad++ or vscode to open the files.
	Briefly:
		common (will have most game altering files)
			defines
				(tells the game how fast or slow to go, and defines the start date)
			governments
				Civics (this is where the custom origins are)
			name_lists
				(this is where the custom imperial namelist is)
			on_actions
				(this is where the game knows that on colonization an event will fire)
			random_names
				(this is where the random star names are generated)
			solar_system_initializers
				(this is where you define the star systems with their planets)
			start_screen_messages
				(the screen that shows up when the game starts per faction)
		events
			(where the bulk of the event goes in how I wrote it. I'm pretty sure there's a better way)
		flags
			(where emblem stuff goes)
		gfx
			(UI related graphics and configurations files)
		interface
			(graphics files and UI defines)
		localisation
			(strictly .yml files that are used for localisation in several languages. E:FF is only offered in English at this time.
		map
			galaxy (galaxy shape files)
			setup_scenarios (static galaxies, this is where the game knows where to put stars and features on the map)
		music
			(must be in OGG. use a song.txt to define the location of the file and song.asset file to add it to the game as a playable song)
		prescripted_countries
			(you can straight up add custom empires in here. go to Documents\Paradox Interactive\Stellaris\user_empire_designs_v3.4.txt
			your custom made empires will be added here. Copy and paste them into a new .txt file in this directory to add them as official empires)
		descriptor.mod
			(this is what can flag the caution icon on the launcher as the version number is indicated here. Some mods are compatible between major version and a wildcard asterisk "*" can be used
			for example 3.10.* would mean that it's been tested for a minor version but hotfixes usually fix problems throughout the game and are patched in after)
		readme.txt
			(you are here)
		thumbnail.png
			(I'm not sure this works but it's the logo for the mod).

	And that's every directory in a nutshell. There's a lot of help online on Stellaris' wiki and on discord.
